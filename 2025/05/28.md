You're balancing mental-heavy tasks (BDT + ToC + RA) and physical training (gym, strength) — to avoid slouching and still storm the gym later, here’s a science-based system tailored to your schedule:

⚡ Xiang's Midday Method: Stay Sharp, Stay Strong

✅ Post-meeting (Now → 10:40 AM)

You've just finished a Chinese meeting and feel tired — this is recovery + light-focus time.

Instead of jumping straight into intense logic work, do:

🔹 BDT Simple Verification
✅ Open tutorial 4 and verify 1 example question only
✅ Type a single sentence summary for memory recall


⏳ 10:40 – 11:10 AM | SPRINT Block

Sit upright, not reclining, with feet flat + laptop raised to eye level (stack books if needed).

Do Pomodoro 1:

Focus: BDT tutorial 5, 1 main question

Timer: 25 min work → 5 min stretch



💪 During the Stretch Breaks:

Stand up, do:

5 push-ups (or incline on desk)

5 squats

5-second chest openers (clasp hands behind back, squeeze shoulder blades)



These “micro-sets” prep your CNS for gym and protect posture.

🏋️‍♂️ How to Storm the Gym Later:

Your session with “Richard Morning” is done, but to storm strength later:

⚡ Between 1:30 PM – 2:00 PM

Add 1 scoop whey protein or 1 egg + banana snack (no need to be full)

Sip water until 2:30 PM

Avoid sugar crash by skipping heavy carb snacks


🧠 4:00 PM RA Code Block

Put music on, treat this like a focus sprint

Sit on edge of seat, straight back, tension = power
